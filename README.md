In this project, i have used a real life dataset based on credit dataset. This dataset was of high dimensionality. The number of attributes in the dataset are 122. There are lots of catagorical attribute and continues attributes.I analyse the whole data with respect to the target. I thoughly go through each and every column in the datset and find out the which attribute is more importantand which attribute is more affecting the target variable
